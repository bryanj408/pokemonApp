# pokemonApp

This app displays a list of pokemon to the user. The user can click on any pokemon and it will display a modal hosting a variety of information including name, height, types, and pictures.

-JavaScript</br>

The app works by using a pre-built PokiAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150) to pull in all the information needed for the user. Using mostly JavaScript, I build the user interface of a list/buttons/modals to display popular pokemon stats in a creative way.
