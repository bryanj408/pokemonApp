# pokemonApp

This app displays a list of pokemon to the user. The user can click on any pokemon and it will display a modal hosting a variety of information including name, height, types, and pictures.   
TECHNOLOGIES USED:
-JavaScript. 
-HTML. 
-CSS

UPDATES COMING:  
-navbar with home button. 
-usable search bar. 

The app works by using a pre-built PokiAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150) to pull in all the information needed for displaying basic information to the user. Using mostly JavaScript, I build the user interface of a list/buttons/modals to display popular pokemon stats in a creative way.
